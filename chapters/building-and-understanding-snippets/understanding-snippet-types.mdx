<Tip>
  **First Key Decision**\
  The first and most fundamental decision you make when creating a new snippet in Crust AI is selecting its **Snippet Type**. This choice determines the core structure and purpose of the mini-application, specifically whether it focuses on displaying the details of a single record or presenting a list of multiple records.
</Tip>

## Single Item vs. Multiple Items Snippets

Crust AI offers two distinct snippet types to cover the most common data visualization and sharing needs:

| Feature             | Single Item Snippet                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Multiple Items Snippet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Designed to focus on and display the comprehensive details of **one specific record** from your chosen Airtable table.                                                                                                                 | Designed to display a **list of records** from your chosen Airtable table. These records can be filtered and sorted according to criteria you define.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Use Cases**       | Sharing a single client's complete profile <br /><br /> Showing the status of a single project <br /><br /> Providing detailed information about one product in your inventory<br /><br /> Presenting the specifics of one legal case. | Creating a dashboard of all _active_ marketing campaigns<br /><br /> Building a client portal showing all _pending_ legal matters for a specific client <br /><br /> Listing _all_ products currently in stock.                                                                                           |
| **Primary View(s)** | This type includes one view:<br /> <br /> • **Detail View**, showing all relevant fields for that singular record.                                                                                                                     | This type includes two interconnected views:<br /><br />• **List View:** The initial display showing a summarized list or overview of multiple records.<br /><br />• **Detail View:** When a user clicks on a specific item in the List View, they navigate to a detailed view of that individual record. |
| **Preview**         | <img   src="/single-snippet.png"   width="200" />                                                                                                                                                                                      | <img   src="/multi-snippet-preview.png"   width="200" />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The List View provides a high-level overview, and the Detail View provides the granular information for each item in that list.

## Views and Navigation

Every snippet has at least a **Detail View**. A Single Item snippet _only_ has a Detail View because its purpose is to show the full information for one predetermined record.

A Multiple Items snippet has both a **List View** and a **Detail View**. The **List View** is the default view when the snippet is opened. From the List View, users can click on any individual item (record) in the list to automatically navigate to that record's **Detail View**.

<Accordion title="Navigating Back">
  When viewing the Detail View of an item within a Multiple Items snippet:

  - In the Crust AI **Snippet Builder interface**, you can use the "List View" toggle button above the phone preview to return to the List View.
  - In the **live, published snippet** (when accessed via its Shareable URL), users simply use their web browser's standard **back button** to return to the List View from the Detail View.
</Accordion>

## Selecting Data for Each Type

The way you define _which_ specific record(s) are displayed differs based on the snippet type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Single Item Snippets">
    In Step 2 of the builder, you'll see a table preview of your Airtable data. You **select the specific record** you want this snippet to display by clicking the radio button next to its row. This selected record defines the core data for this _specific_ Single Item snippet URL.

    ![Quick Start Single Snippet Record Selection Gi](/images/quick-start-single-snippet-record-selection.gif)

    The Shareable URL for this snippet will be built to directly reference the unique ID of the record you selected. Sharing this specific URL will _always_ open the snippet showing the details of that particular record.

    - Learn how this affects the URL structure: [Understanding the Shareable URL Structure](/chapters/sharing-your-snippets/understanding-the-shareable-url-structure)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Multiple Items Snippets">
    In Step 2, all records from your chosen table are initially available. You then define which records are _eligible_ to be shown in the list using the **Filter** and **Permission** settings.

    ![Data Access Config Pn](/images/data-access-config.png)

    - **Filters:** Apply static rules (e.g., `Status is "Active"`) to permanently exclude irrelevant records from being considered for the snippet. Anyone viewing the snippet, regardless of their identity, will only ever see records that pass these filters.
    - **Permissions (User-based):** Apply dynamic rules based on the viewer's identity to restrict which records from the _filtered_ set they are allowed to see (e.g., `Client Email is the viewer's email`). This allows the same snippet URL to show different data to different users.
    - **Sorting:** Define the display order of the records in the list view.

## How Configuration Changes Affect Shared Links

<Warning>
  **Important**\
  Read this to avoid confusion and manage your snippets effectively
</Warning>

**Filters and Sorting**

Any changes you make to the **Filter** or **Sort** settings in Step 2 of the builder will **immediately affect ALL** existing and future Shareable URLs for that specific snippet.

If you update a filter to exclude certain records, those records will instantly disappear from any live view of that snippet's URL.

If you need two different lists of data from the _same_ table (e.g., one showing only `` `Active` `` campaigns and another showing only `` `Completed` `` campaigns), you should create two _separate_ Multiple Items snippets, each with its own filter configuration.

**Permissions (User-based)**

Changing the **Permission** setting (specifically enabling or changing the permission field) in Step 2 **does NOT require you to create a new snippet URL to show different data**.

The power of user-based permission is that the _same base URL_ (e.g., `` `https://app.trycrust.ai/snippets/<your_snippet_id>/view/multi` ``) can present _different_ data to different users because the permission value is passed _dynamically_ via the URL parameter (`` `?p=<permission_value>` ``).

This allows you to create _one_ snippet configured for user-based permission and use it to share personalized data views with many different clients.

Understanding this distinction is vital for correctly managing your shared data and creating efficient workflows.
