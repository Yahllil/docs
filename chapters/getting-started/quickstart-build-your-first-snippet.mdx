  **Hands-On Example**\
  This quickstart will guide you through creating a basic snippet using Crust AI, demonstrating the core steps and concepts. We'll use a simple example of a marketing agency wanting to share campaign performance with their clients.
</Tip>

## Our Example Airtable Base: Marketing Campaigns

Imagine you have an Airtable base to manage your marketing campaigns. Let's say you have a "Campaigns" table with fields like:

<ResponseField name="Campaign Name" type="Single line text">
  The name of the marketing campaign.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Status" type="Single select">
  Current status of the campaign (e.g., Planning, Active, Paused, Completed).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Start Date" type="Date">
  The date the campaign begins.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="End Date" type="Date">
  The date the campaign ends.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Budget" type="Currency">
  The allocated budget for the campaign.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Clicks" type="Number">
  Number of clicks generated by the campaign.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Impressions" type="Number">
  Number of impressions generated by the campaign.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Conversions" type="Number">
  Number of conversions attributed to the campaign.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Client Email" type="Email">
  The email address of the client associated with the campaign. Used for permissions.
</ResponseField>

This base allows you to track various campaigns and which client they belong to.

![Clean Shot2025 05 05at14 49 07@2x Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-05-05at14.49.07@2x.png)

Our goal is to create a shareable mini-app for each client where they can see the status and performance metrics of only their campaigns.

## Step 1: Connect Your Airtable Base

1. Go to [app.trycrust.ai](https://app.trycrust.ai) and sign in.
2. You'll be prompted to connect your Airtable base. Click the `Connect Airtable` button.
3. Follow the prompts in the Airtable authorization window that appears. Select the workspace and the specific base containing your "Campaigns" table.
4. Grant Crust AI the requested permissions (read access to data and structure, and write access if you plan to add interactive elements later).

[Gif showing the process from clicking "Connect Airtable", selecting a workspace and base in the Airtable authorization pop-up, and confirming access.]

Once connected, you'll see the "Your Snippets" dashboard.

[Screenshot of the "Your Snippets" dashboard showing a "Create New Snippet" card.]

## Step 2: Create a New Snippet

1. Click the `Create New Snippet` button.
2. Select the Airtable base you just connected (e.g., "Marketing Campaigns").
3. Select the table you want to build the snippet from (e.g., "Campaigns").
4. Click `Create Snippet`.

[Gif showing clicking "Create New Snippet", selecting the base, selecting the "Campaigns" table, and clicking "Create Snippet".]

Crust AI's AI will now analyze the structure of your selected table and begin generating the initial snippet interface. This may take a moment.

---

## Step 3: Configure a Single Item Snippet (Detail View)

By default, Crust AI sets a "Single Item Snippet" type initially.

![Clean Shot2025 05 05at17 20 11@2x Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-05-05at17.20.11@2x.png)

### Understanding Single Item Snippets

A Single Item Snippet focuses on showing the details of just one record. On the left side of the screen, you see a preview of your table data. The phone preview on the right shows how the details of the currently selected record in the table preview would look in the snippet's Detail View.

You can click on different records in the table preview on the left to see how the phone preview on the right updates to show the details of that specific record.

![Quick Start Single Snippet Record Selection Gi](/images/quick-start-single-snippet-record-selection.gif)

### About Shareable URLs for Single Item Snippets

The Shareable URL for a Single Item Snippet is designed to point to a specific record. It typically includes the record's unique ID as a parameter in the URL. If you get the shareable URL for a Single Item Snippet, you'll notice a parameter like `?rec=recXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` at the end of the URL. Changing the record selected in the builder before getting the URL will result in a different record ID in the URL, linking to that specific record.

To learn more about how this works, see: [Understanding the Shareable URL Structure](/chapters/sharing-your-snippets/understanding-the-shareable-url-structure)

To learn how to set which specific record is shown in the single item snippet, see: [Selecting a Record for Single Item Snippets](/chapters/selecting-which-data-to-display/selecting-a-record-for-single-item-snippets)

---

## Step 4: Customize the Appearance (Optional)

While the AI generates a functional starting point, you can easily customize the look and feel. In the "Make It Perfect" section (Step 3), you can use natural language prompts to request design changes.

For example you could type something like:

```
"Make the header red"
```

The AI will process your request and update the visual preview.

![Quickstart Prompt Gi](/images/quickstart-prompt.gif)

You can also preview the snippet on different devices (mobile or desktop).

  **Design Tips**\
  To learn more about customizing the design, see: [Customizing the Snippet UI/UX](/chapters/customizing-design-and-appearance/customizing-the-snippet-ui-ux)
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Change to a Multiple Items Snippet (List View \+ Detail View)

Now, let's say you want a client to see all their campaigns in a list, not just one at a time.

1. In the Snippet Builder, go back to Step 1: "Select Snippet Type."
2. Choose the `Multiple Items` type.

![Quickstart Change To Multi Gi](/images/quickstart-change-to-multi.gif)

The right-side preview now unlocks the List View, displaying multiple records from your table (initially, all records). You'll also see a button or option to switch between the List View and Detail View above the phone preview in step 3.

<Info>
  **Navigation Between Views**\
  In a Multiple Items snippet, the Detail View is accessed by clicking on a specific item within the List View. Crust AI automatically sets up this navigation for you.
</Info>

---

## Step 6: Control Which Items Appear: Set Permissions

By default, the Multiple Items snippet shows all records from the table. To ensure a client only sees their own campaigns, we will set up User-based Permission.

1. Go to Step 2: "Set Filters & Permissions."
2. Click on the `Permission` tab within this section.
3. Select the `User-based permission` option.
4. You'll be asked "Which field holds the user's identifier?". Choose the field in your Campaigns table that contains the value you'll use to identify the user. In our example, this is the `Client Email` field.
5. Click `Apply Permission`.

![Quickstart Permission Setup Gi](/images/quickstart-permission-setup.gif)

Now, when someone accesses this snippet, Crust AI will require an identifier (the client's email) to filter the list.

**Testing Permissions**

To test this, use the "View as" input that appears after setting permissions. Enter the email address of one of your clients (e.g., `jamie@example.com`). The preview will update to show only the campaigns linked to that email address.

You can also set static Filters and Sorting options here to further refine the list shown to users. Learn more on the: [Setting Filters & Sorting for Multiple Items Snippets](/chapters/selecting-which-data-to-display/setting-filters-and-sorting-for-multiple-items-snippets)

---

## Step 7: Share Your Snippet

Once your Multiple Items snippet is configured, you're ready to share it.

1. Click the `Get Shareable URL` button at the bottom.

![Quickstart Share Pn](/images/quickstart-share.png)

For a User-based permission snippet, the standard shareable URL will ask the viewers to enter their permission value. In this case, the client email.

![Quickstart User Permission Access Required Pn](/images/quickstart-user-permission-access-required.png)

<Accordion title="Creating Direct URL 'Magic' Links">
  If you want to share a pre-filled 'Magic Link' that automatically submits a permission value and filters for a specific user:

  1. Use the "View as" feature to enter an email
  2. Click the small 'Copy Direct URL' icon next to the email address

  This copies a link that will automatically include the permissions value, and will authenticate the viewer without asking for permission value.

  ![Quickstart Copy Direct Url Gi](/images/quickstart-copy-direct-url.gif)

  This direct URL includes the permission value as a query parameter, for example:

  ```
  https://app.trycrust.ai/snippets/<your_snippet_id>/view/multi?p=jamie@example.com
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Sharing Options">
  Learn more about the different ways to share snippets and the URL structure: [Understanding the Shareable URL Structure](/chapters/sharing-your-snippets/understanding-the-shareable-url-structure) and [Share a Snippet Directly from Airtable](/chapters/update-data-and-trigger-actions/fire-an-automation-directly-from-a-snippet).

  You can also dynamically generate these URLs for each record in Airtable using a Button field or formula, allowing you to link directly from your base to the relevant snippet view for a client. Learn how on: [Share a Snippet Directly from Airtable](/chapters/update-data-and-trigger-actions/fire-an-automation-directly-from-a-snippet).

  These direct URLs can also be used in automation tools like Make or Zapier to automatically send personalized snippet links. Learn how on: [Integrate a Snippet in a Make/Zapier Flow](/chapters/sharing-your-snippets/integrate-a-snippet-in-a-make-or-zapier-flow)
