## What is Crust AI?

Crust AI is an AI-powered platform built specifically to extend the capabilities of Airtable. It allows you to take data from your Airtable bases and instantly transform it into visually appealing, interactive, and live mini-applications called **Snippets**.

## Why Crust AI?

<Warning>
  **The Airtable Sharing Challenge**\
  Airtable is a fantastic tool for organizing and managing data internally. However, sharing specific, live data with people outside your immediate team â€“ clients, vendors, external collaborators, or partners â€“ can often be challenging.

  - **Complexity for External Users:** Inviting external users to your full Airtable base can expose them to unnecessary complexity and potentially sensitive data.
  - **Limited Control in Standard Shares:** Standard Airtable share links or views offer limited control over what specific records or fields an external user can see and interact with.
  - **Lack of Realâ€‘time Interaction:** Enabling external users to _update_ data in Airtable (e.g., marking a task complete, providing feedback) often requires complex workarounds or separate tools.
  - **Unbranded Experience:** Standard Airtable interfaces or data exports lack the professional, branded experience your clients might expect.
</Warning>

## AIâ€‘Powered Snippets

**What are Snippets?**\
Snippets are the core output of Crust AI. They serve as dedicated, focused windows into specific parts of your data, designed for particular external audiences or use cases.

- **AI-Generated:** Intelligent analysis of your Airtable structure
- **Interactive:** Enable viewing and updating of your data
- **Shareable:** Unique URLs that work on any device
- **Connected:** Real-time, two-way sync with Airtable

ðŸ’¡ **How It Works**\
Crust AI analyzes your Airtable table structure (field types, names, relationships) to propose a functional and visually intuitive layout automatically. You then refine this layout and add custom logic or interactions using simple language prompts or straightforward configuration options.

## Common Use Cases

- **Client Portals:** Create custom dashboards or portals for your clients to view their specific projects, performance, or billing information directly through a self-serve interface.
- **External Communication:** Share live data with partners, vendors, or stakeholders without granting them access to your entire Airtable base.
- **Internal Workflows:** Build simple, mobile-friendly interfaces for teams needing quick access or input for specific tasks (e.g., field technicians checking inventory).
- **Branded Experiences:** Deliver clean, polished interfaces that feel like custom-built applications, elevating your clients' perception of your service.
