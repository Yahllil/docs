<Tip>
  **Trigger Complex Workflows**\
  Crust AI snippets can do more than just display or update simple field values; they can also serve as the user interface to initiate complex workflows and automations managed outside of Crust AI itself.
</Tip>

Integrating automations in a snippet allows your end-users to trigger actions like sending customized emails, generating reports, updating multiple related records, or integrating with other systems (like Make, Zapier, n8n, or custom webhooks) directly from the snippet interface.

## The Core Mechanism: Triggering an Airtable Button Field

The key to triggering external automations from Crust AI lies in leveraging Airtable's **Button field type**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Automation (External)">
    First, ensure your desired automation workflow is configured in your chosen tool (Airtable Native Automation, Make, Zapier, n8n, custom webhook endpoint, etc.). Obtain the specific **Webhook URL** or **Trigger URL** required to start this automation.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Airtable Button Field">
    In the Airtable table that your snippet is based on, create a new field of type **Button**.

    - Configure the button's action, typically **Open URL**.
    - In the URL formula box, paste the **Webhook URL/Trigger URL** obtained in Step 1. You can often include dynamic data from the record in the URL using an Airtable formula if your automation requires it (e.g., `"https://hook.make.com/your-webhook?recordId=" & RECORD_ID()`).
    - Give the button a clear label in Airtable (e.g., "Send Welcome Email", "Generate PDF Report").

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Button to Snippet (Crust AI)">
    Use the **AI Prompt** in Step 3 of the Crust AI Snippet Builder to instruct the AI to add a corresponding button to your snippet interface:

    ```
    Add a button labeled 'Send Welcome Email' that triggers the 'Send Welcome Email' button field.
    ```

    ```
    Place a 'Generate Report' button here that executes the action of the 'Generate PDF Report' Airtable button.
    ```

## How It Works

When the end-user clicks the button _within the published Crust AI snippet_ (this functionality typically does not execute within the builder preview), Crust AI initiates the action configured for the corresponding Airtable Button field. In most automation cases, this means Crust AI makes an HTTP request to the configured Webhook URL.

Your external automation service (Airtable, Make, Zapier, n8n, etc.) then receives this trigger via the webhook and executes its predefined workflow, potentially using any data passed along in the URL.

This allows you to embed powerful backend processes behind simple buttons in your user-facing snippets, keeping the complexity hidden from the end-user while still empowering them to initiate actions.

## Benefits

- **Simplified User Experience:** Users trigger complex workflows with a single click in a clean interface.
- **Centralized Automation Logic:** Keep your automation workflows within your preferred tools (Airtable, Make, Zapier, etc.).
- **Enhanced Functionality:** Add capabilities to your snippets far beyond simple data display and editing.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly connect your snippet front-end to various backend services and platforms.
