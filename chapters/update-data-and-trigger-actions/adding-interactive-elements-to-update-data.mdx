  **Make Your Snippets Interactive**  
  While changing the visual design is a key part of customizing snippets, the AI prompt in Step 3 plays another crucial role: **making your snippets interactive**.
</Tip>

## Beyond Read-Only: Enabling Interaction

By default, snippets are read-only displays of your Airtable data. They show live information, but end-users cannot typically modify the data directly through the snippet interface.

However, Crust AI allows you to add interactive elements, transforming your snippets from simple data viewers into functional mini-apps that can do things like:

### Interactive Capabilities
  *   **Edit Specific Fields:** Allow users to change the value of certain fields within a record directly from the snippet (e.g., update a status, check a box, edit value).
  *   **Trigger Airtable Buttons & Automations:** Add buttons within the snippet that, when clicked, execute the action of an Airtable Button field in the corresponding record (often used to trigger Airtable automations, webhooks, or scripts).
  *   **Implement Conditional Logic:** Make interactive elements appear or behave differently based on the data in the current record.

## Adding Interactivity via the AI Prompt

Just like visual customization, adding interactivity is achieved through natural language instructions in the **AI Prompt** input field (located below the phone preview in Step 3).

You simply describe the functionality you want to add:

#### Field Editing

```
Add a dropdown menu to allow the user to change the 'Status' field.
```

*(This makes *only* the Status field editable via a dropdown, keeping other fields read-only).*

```
Make the 'Notes' field editable using a text input.
```

```
Add a checkbox to check/uncheck the 'Approved' field.
```

<br/>

#### Triggering Airtable Actions

```
Add a button labeled 'Send Email' that triggers the action of the 'Send Email' button field.
```

```
Add a button that when pressed, the URL of the 'Generate Report' button field will be triggered.
```

<br/>

#### Conditional Interaction

```
If the 'Status' is 'Pending Approval', add a button titled 'Approve Campaign' that changes the 'Status' field to 'Approved' AND triggers the URL of the 'Notify Client' button field.
```

*(This demonstrates combining a field update and an Airtable action trigger in one interaction, conditional on the current status).*

## Snippet-Specific Functionality (e.g., Filtering the View)

The prompt can also add interactive elements that control the snippet's view *itself*, rather than directly modifying Airtable data. For example:

```
Add filter buttons at the top that allow the user to filter the list by the 'Status' field.
```

```
Add a toggle switch to hide/show records where 'Priority' is 'Low'.
```

<Info>
  **Important Distinction**  
  These prompt-added filters operate *only on the data already loaded into the snippet*. They filter the records that have *already passed* the static Filters and user-based Permissions set in Step 2. They do not change the underlying data selection rules defined in Step 2. Think of them as convenient UI controls for the end-user to further refine the *currently visible* list.

By instructing the AI prompt, you can easily add powerful interactive capabilities to your snippets, allowing end-users to not only view but also interact with and update your Airtable data in a controlled and intuitive way.
