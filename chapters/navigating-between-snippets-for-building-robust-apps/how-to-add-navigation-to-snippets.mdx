<Tip>
  **Building Navigation Flows**\
  One of the most powerful aspects of Crust AI is the ability to connect multiple snippets together, creating intuitive navigation flows. This transforms individual data views into cohesive, app-like experiences without requiring traditional coding skills.
</Tip>

## Understanding Navigation Types

Before diving into implementation, it's helpful to understand the different types of navigation you can create between snippets:

### Types of Navigation

1. **Automatic List-to-Detail Navigation** - Built into Multiple Items snippets.
2. **General Snippet Navigation** - Navigating between snippets without passing specific context or permissions.
3. **Contextual Navigation** - Passing parameters (`rec=` or `p=`) between snippets to maintain context or apply permissions dynamically.

---

## Automatic List-to-Detail Navigation

The most basic form of navigation is already built into every **Multiple Items snippet** by default:

<Info>
  **Built-In Functionality**\
  In any Multiple Items snippet, when a user clicks on an item in the List View, they're automatically taken to the Detail View for that specific record. This happens without any configuration on your part - it's a core feature of Multiple Items snippets.
</Info>

The navigation back from Detail View to List View is handled by the browser's default back button in the published snippet.

---

## Creating Navigation Between Snippets

While the automatic List-to-Detail navigation within a single snippet is helpful, the real power comes from connecting different snippets together. Here's how to create navigation buttons between separate snippets:

### Step 1: Create Your Snippets

First, ensure you have created the snippets you want to connect:

1. Create your "origin" snippet (where the navigation begins).
2. Create your "target" snippet (where the user will navigate to).
3. Get the **Shareable URL** of your target snippet (you'll likely modify this later).

### Step 2: Add a Button Field in Airtable

To create navigation between snippets, you'll use Airtable's **Button** field type:

1. Go to your Airtable base.
2. Open the table that your **origin** snippet is based on.
3. Add a new field of type **Button**.
4. Name it descriptively (e.g., "View Tasks").
5. Set the action to **Open URL**.
6. In the URL formula, paste the base Shareable URL of your **target** snippet. We'll add dynamic parameters later if needed.

<Tip>
  **URL Structure is Key**\
  Understanding [Shareable URL Structure](/chapters/sharing-your-snippets/understanding-the-shareable-url-structure) is crucial for effective navigation. The URL parameters (`rec=` or `p=`) determine exactly what data will be shown in the target snippet.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add the Button to Your Origin Snippet

After adding the button field in Airtable:

1. Return to your **origin** snippet in the Crust AI Builder.
2. **Refresh the page** (or use the schema refresh option) to ensure Crust AI sees the new button field from Airtable.
3. In Step 3 "Make It Perfect", use the AI prompt to add the button to your snippet's UI. For example:

   ```text Prompt Example
   Add the 'View Tasks' button that navigates to its URL when clicked
   ```

## Step-by-Step Example: Project to Tasks Navigation

Let's walk through a complete example of setting up navigation between two related snippets, ensuring the target snippet shows contextually relevant data.

### Scenario Setup

Imagine you have two tables in Airtable:

- **Projects** table (with fields: Project Name, Client, Status, etc.)
- **Tasks** table (with fields: Task Name, Project (a _link_ to the Projects table), Status, etc.)

Your goal is to create:

1. A **Project Detail** snippet (Single Item) showing detailed information about one project.
2. A **Project Tasks** snippet (Multiple Items) showing _only_ tasks related to a specific project.
3. Navigation from the Project Detail snippet to its related Tasks List snippet.

[Screenshot of Airtable showing the two tables: Projects and Tasks, with the link between them highlighted]

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Both Snippets">
    1. **Create Project Detail Snippet:**
       - Follow the [Quickstart guide](/chapters/getting-started/quickstart-build-your-first-snippet) to create a **Single Item** snippet based on your **Projects** table. Customize as needed.
         [Screenshot of the complete Project Detail snippet in the Builder]
    2. **Create Project Tasks Snippet:**
       - Create a **Multiple Items** snippet based on your **Tasks** table. Customize as needed. _Initially, this will show ALL tasks._
         [Screenshot of the Tasks snippet Builder with the filter configuration panel visible]
    3. **Get Tasks Snippet URL:**
       - In the Tasks snippet builder, go to Step 4 and click "Get Shareable URL".
       - Copy the base URL (e.g., `https://app.trycrust.ai/<your_tasks_snippet_id>/list`). We'll add parameters later. [Screenshot of the copied URL with the structure highlighted]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Navigation Button (Airtable)">
    1. Go to your **Projects** table in Airtable.
    2. Add a new **Button** field named "View Tasks".
    3. Set the action to **Open URL**.
    4. In the URL formula, paste the **Tasks** snippet base URL (copied in the previous step). _We will modify this URL later to pass context._

       ```airtable_formula
       "https://app.trycrust.ai/<your_tasks_snippet_id>/list"
       ```

       _`(Replace <your_tasks_snippet_id>)`_
       [Screenshot of the Airtable Button field configuration showing the initial formula]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Tasks Snippet Permission (Crust AI)">
    To ensure the Tasks snippet only shows tasks for the _clicked_ project, we need User-based Permission based on the Project's Record ID.

    1. **Expose Project Record ID (Airtable):**
       - In your **Projects** table, add a **Formula** field named `Project Record ID` with the formula `RECORD_ID()`.
    2. **Lookup Project Record ID (Airtable):**
       - In your **Tasks** table, add a **Lookup** field named `Project Record ID Lookup`.
       - Configure it to look up from the `Project` linked record field.
       - Choose the `Project Record ID` formula field from the Projects table to retrieve.
    3. **Set Permission Field (Crust AI):**
       - Go back to your **Tasks** snippet in the Builder (refresh if needed).
       - Go to **Step 2 -\> Permission**.
       - Select **User-based permission**.
       - In the "Which field holds the user's identifier?" dropdown, select your new **`Project Record ID Lookup`** field.
       - Click **Apply Permission**.
         [Screenshot of the Permission configuration in the Tasks snippet Builder showing the lookup field selected]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update 'View Tasks' Button URL (Airtable)">
    Now, modify the "View Tasks" button formula in the **Projects** table to pass the current project's Record ID as the permission parameter (`p`).

    1. Edit the "View Tasks" button field configuration.
    2. Update the formula to:

       ```
       "https://app.trycrust.ai/<your_tasks_snippet_id>/list?p=" & RECORD_ID()
       ```

       _`(Replace <your_tasks_snippet_id>)`_
       [Screenshot of the updated Airtable Button field configuration]

       </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Button to Project Detail Snippet (Crust AI)">
    1. Go back to your **Project Detail** snippet in the Builder.
    2. **Refresh the page** to ensure Crust AI sees the updated "View Tasks" button field from Airtable.
    3. In Step 3 "Make It Perfect", use the AI prompt:

       ```text Prompt Example
       Add the 'View Tasks' button in a prominent position below the project details
       ```

       [Screenshot of the AI prompt and the resulting button in the Project Detail snippet]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Navigation">
    Now when a user views the Project Detail snippet and clicks the "View Tasks" button:

    1. They'll navigate to the Tasks snippet URL, which now includes `?p=<project_record_id>`.
    2. The Tasks snippet will use the provided Project Record ID to dynamically filter and show only tasks related to the original project (matching the `Project Record ID Lookup` field).
    3. The user can navigate back using the browser's default back button.

## Advanced Navigation Scenarios

<Accordion title="Navigating to a Single Item Snippet">
  When you want to link directly to the Detail View of a specific record (useful for linking _from_ a list view to a dedicated Single Item snippet instead of the built-in detail view), you need to include the `rec` parameter with the target record's ID:

  ```
  https://app.trycrust.ai/snippets/<snippet_id>/view/single?rec=<record_id>
  ```

  In Airtable, you can make this dynamic using the `RECORD_ID()` function in your button field formula:

  ```
      "https://app.trycrust.ai/snippets/<target_snippet_id>/view/single?rec=" & RECORD_ID()
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Complex Permission Parameters">
  For Multiple Items snippets with user-based permissions, you can pass any value via the `p` parameter that identifies the relationship or user context:

  ```text URL Structure
  https://app.trycrust.ai/snippets/<snippet_id>/view/multi?p=<permission_value>
  ```

  This could be an email, a record ID (as in the example), or any other unique identifier that matches your configured permission field in the target snippet.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  **Important Considerations**

  - **Always refresh** your snippet in the Builder after adding or modifying button fields in Airtable.
  - **Test your navigation flows** thoroughly before sharing with end-users, ensuring the correct parameters are passed.
  - If navigation doesn't filter data as expected, double-check:
    - Your URL parameters (`rec=` or `p=`) in the Airtable button formula.
    - The permission field configuration in the target snippet (Step 2 -\> Permission).
    - That the value being passed in the URL parameter _exactly matches_ the format and value expected in the permission field (including Lookup field values).
</Warning>
